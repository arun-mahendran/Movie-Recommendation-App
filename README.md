How It Works

The app loads a sample dataset of movies with poster URLs and metadata.

Users can search, filter, and sort movies dynamically.

Ratings and watchlist data are saved in the browser using localStorage.

Recommendations are generated based on the userâ€™s watchlist and ratings.

The UI is fully responsive and works across desktop and mobile devices.

Future Enhancements

Integrate with a real movie API (e.g., TMDb) to fetch live data.

Add user authentication for personal watchlists across devices.

Include reviews, trailers, and more movie details.

Implement advanced recommendation algorithms (collaborative or content-based filtering).
